# Transport Management Website (Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS)

Each page has its **own** HTML, CSS, and JS file as requested.
Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site locally (no build tools needed).

## Structure
- index.html        -> css/index.css, js/index.js
- about.html        -> css/about.css, js/about.js
- services.html     -> css/services.css, js/services.js
- pricing.html      -> css/pricing.css, js/pricing.js
- contact.html      -> css/contact.css, js/contact.js
- blog.html         -> css/blog.css, js/blog.js
- img/              -> put your logos and images here

## Next steps (suggested)
1) Replace placeholder copy with your real text.
2) Update logos/accreditations in About.
3) Tweak pricing numbers in js/pricing.js.
4) Replace booking alert with your Calendly/BookWhen link (see common handlers in each page's JS).
5) Connect the Contact form to Formspree (simple) or your own backend later.

Happy building! ðŸšš
